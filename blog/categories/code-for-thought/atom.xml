<p>Before starting this job, I never quite understood why my programmer friends always wanted the latest computer - the faster the better. I also never understood why it was so important to shorten or abbreviate commands such as <code>rails server</code> to <code>rails s</code>. Does typing an extra five characters really matter that much?</p>

<p>This week flew by with impressive speed. This entire week I was either waitressing at the restaurant or sitting in front of a computer, learning or implementing Ruby. And honestly, I feel as if I didn&rsquo;t have enough time in the day to get everything done that I wanted to get done just at Quottly alone. one minute I wrapped my head around Regular Expressions and the next I notice that two hours have gone by in a blink of an eye! When you sit in front of the computer, working with code, it&rsquo;s as if you get stuck into a flow, where for you, time stands still; a minute could be a day or a day could be a minute. When time moves so quickly, every second counts. Every minute that you wait for the computer to load the server takes a good ten minutes off of your day depending on how often you load the server. And then add other factors like playing around with &lsquo;byebug&rsquo; or writing long strings and methods, every character takes a fraction of a second which adds. By the end of the week, the time that was wasted by a slow computer or taking time to type out an entire command could easily add up to half a day. You know what can be accomplished in half a day? A lot. A lot of learning can be accomplished in half a day.</p>

<p>On the same note, I&rsquo;ve decided to cut Netflix out of my life along with the Facebook App on my phone. I am considering deleting Snapchat as well. There are so many things that we have in life that are a distraction and that take time away from our ultimate goals. One of my goals is to be able to read Spanish poetry and guaranteed, if I were to take the amount of hours I spent watching &ldquo;Bones&rdquo; on Netflix this past year alone and instead had spent it on Spanish poetry lessons - I would be gosh darn fluent by now. And I have to ask myself, what good has re-watching &ldquo;Bones&rdquo; been to my life? It has contributed nothing, while Spanish poetry could open the door to so many wondrous and beautiful thoughts.</p>

<p>I feel as if, after graduating, it is incredibly easy to fall into a rut - to go to work, come home exhausted, put on the TV, eat fattening food, and pass out on the couch. I have seen many of my older friends go through this and then two years down the line they are slightly overweight and feeling miserable about their lives. That is not what I plan to do. Three jobs or one job, I am trying to push myself every time I come home to work on something new whether it&rsquo;s blog posts, applying for scholarships, or furthering my programming knowledge, regardless of how tired I am. Because I know, in two or five or ten years down the line, I am not going to remember the fatigue - instead I am going to be proud of where I have ended up.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Everyday I am learning something new</h4>

<p>Today, I learned about databases and migrations. It seems like such a big thing for many intro books to gloss over but gloss over it they do. And there might be good reason to, it&rsquo;s complicated stuff! Even now as I type this I am not quite sure what databases are or how migrations work. However, I do know that naming conventions with Ruby is a tricky business and I learned that lesson the hard way today.</p>

<p>Working on MobiDick, I decided to create a personal bookshelf which I decided to name &lsquo;Pershelf&rsquo;, a nice, easy, and explanatory name (or so I thought). I ran</p>

<p><code>$ bin/rails generate scaffold Pershelf</code></p>

<p><code>$ bin/rails db: migrate</code></p>

<p>Everything so far okay. I modified the app/controllers/concerns/current_pershelf.rb folder and continued to the next step;</p>

<p><code>$ bin/rails generate scaffold LineItem book:references pershelve:belongs_to</code></p>

<p><code>$ bin/rails db:migrate</code></p>

<!--more-->


<p>Aaanddd now the problems begin. I spent a few hours going through test trying to figure out what went wrong, over and over again finding myself with an &lsquo;Undefined variable&rsquo; error. I saw that some files were labeled &lsquo;pershelve&rsquo; and immediately assumed that Ruby had incorrectly tried to pluralize then put the noun into singular form and messed up miserably so I went through all the files trying to rename everything to &lsquo;pershelf&rsquo; and then would put the plural as &lsquo;pershelfs&rsquo;. That definitely did not work. It wasn&rsquo;t until a co-worker of mine told me to look at the /db/schema.rb to take a look at how the database was set up. There it was! There error was as bright as day.</p>

<p>I would never have thought to look at the database and once we realized that it was clearly human error that caused the issues, my co-worker walked me through the steps of fixing the error;</p>

<p>I learned four important lessons today;</p>

<p>Ruby can, in fact, pluralize like a pro (I would love to see how ruby learned to do it so well!)</p>

<p>Maybe coding while sick and with fever is not the best way to code</p>

<p>Keep track of your spelling conventions!</p>

<p>I learned how to fix errors in the database!</p>

<p>pluralization of ruby in rails when generating scaffolding</p>

<p>When you use rails to build scaffolding, it will expect certain conventions</p>

    <id>http://dukeran.github.io/blog/2016/06/27/dealing-with-db-seed-issues</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Dealing with db:seed issues</h4>

<p>Today I added some information into the seeds.rb file and ran <code>$ bin/rails db:seed</code> and then <code>$ ran bin/rails s</code>. To my horror, all the information that I had had was gone! No errors showed up on local host and I felt at a loss since my understanding of databases is so limited. Thankfully with the help of my co-worker, we figured out a solution.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I learned:</p>

<p>If an error occurs with <code>$ bin/rails db:seed</code>, the error can be silent and not appear either on your console or on local host. It&rsquo;s almost like asking Rails what&rsquo;s wrong and she replies wistfully - nothing - but you know something is wrong. So you go ask Ruby by going into the Rails console and start running some tests;</p>

<p><code>$ rails c</code></p>

<p><code>$ Book.all</code>
<br>
 <code>...Book Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "books".* FROM "books"
 =&gt; #&lt;ActiveRecord::Relation []&gt;</code></p>

<!--more-->


<p> Nothing there, at least that tells me that something is wrong, we just don&rsquo;t know what yet.</p>

<p> Here&rsquo;s where we create a book on the console to be able to see what and where things go wrong;</p>

<p><code>$ Book.create!(title: 'WinniePoo', description: %{&lt;p&gt; hello &lt;/p&gt;}, image_url: 'lol.jpg', review: 5.0)</code></p>

<p>(use bang method to throw an error, otherwise it&rsquo;ll fail silently once again) Bang method usually has a destructive side effect when running with a command. Bang is like the antithesis of the command. It is a powerful method that I just learned today! Bang method is unique to the function. (fix this)</p>

<p>I was able to <code>$ bin/rails db:seed</code> and my page is showing the books and data once again :D</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>The Beginnings</h3>

<p>A couple of days ago I started at my job working for the up and coming ventured back Quottly! It&rsquo;s a starting intern position and I am incredibly excited to for them. For me it&rsquo;s more than just a job, it means progress and growth from when I started a little over a year ago with my first ever programming book. I remember opening the first few pages of that programming book while there was some down time at my waitressing job. A customer has just turned my day from okay to miserable with a few nasty comments and I remembered the book that had been given to me by my good friend James when I had shown some interest in what he did for a living. I had at first taken it a little skeptically, thinking that someone like me could/would never learn to program, that it was already too late for me to start. But after glaring at the customer who had just left I was ready to try to do anything to get out of ever waiting another table again. If there was one thing I knew, it was that I had way too little patience and too much pride to wait on tables for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>Sixth months later I quit my waitressing job to focus on programming and to live life as a broke college student. Seven months later I got hired as a Developer Intern at Quottly, working for the same friend who had given me the book in the first place. I had often come to Quottly&rsquo;s office to work on self-teaching programming books that James had given me or that I had downloaded from various sites after working hours. I would stay up until late at night and would drink copious amounts of coffee until I had learned just enough to get started. Now that my foot is in the door I am hoping that nothing will hold me back!</p>

<p>That enthusiastic attitude that I had my first day nearly died earlier today once faced with the task of setting up. What is it about setting up the workspace that always takes me forever? In the very beginning, it was issues with Git, then it was issues with Rails servers, and today, it was an issue with postgres.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>It appeared that setting up a Development Environment on OSX would be easy enough. I doubled check to make sure I had Homebrew up and working</p>

<p><code>$ brew --version</code></p>

<p>Used RVM to install the correct Ruby version and then&hellip; came the trouble. Installing postgres can be very simple if everything is going right (which it rarely does for me);</p>

<p><code>$ brew install postgres</code></p>

<p>Then launch the following commands;</p>

<p><code>$ ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents</code></p>

<p><code>$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist</code></p>

<p>It appeared to be installing properly, everything looked nice, green, and working. Then there was this message right under a few paragraphs;</p>

<p><code>...fixing permissions on existing directory /usr/local/var/postgres ... initdb: could not change permissions of directory "/usr/local/var/postgres": Operation not permitted</code></p>

<p>hmmm. The first few times I tried installing and re-installing postgres (after failure to migrate) I hadn&rsquo;t noticed the message. If this message goes unnoticed, you&rsquo;re not able to <code>rake db:create db:migrate db:seed</code>. When I tried to <code>rake db:migrate</code> with the above mentioned error, I a long block of code (this is just the snippet);</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip;/usr/local/Cellar/ruby/1.9.3-p327/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activerecord-3.2.8/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql_adapter.rb:1213:in <code>initialize'

/usr/local/Cellar/ruby/1.9.3-p327/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activerecord-3.2.8/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql_adapter.rb:329:in</code>initialize'
/usr/local/Cellar/ruby/1.9.3-p327/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activerecord-3.2.8/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql_adapter.rb:28:in `new'
&hellip;..
&hellip;&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Yikes!</p>

<p>A teammate suggested typing;</p>

<p><code>$ psql</code></p>

<p>and I received back;</p>

<p><code>...Is the server running locally and accepting
    connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432</code></p>

<p>Fishy stuff. That at least got us on the right track. At this point I had uninstalled and re-installed postgres multiple times to no avail. The files existed for postgres! I check them multiple times at</p>

<p><code>$ ls /usr/local/var/postgres/</code></p>

<p>But it still wouldn&rsquo;t work. Then, I did something that I should&rsquo;ve done from the very, very, very beginning. Would have saved me and others hours. I went to the troubleshooting link that was in the message sent to me after installing postgres;</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting">https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting</a></p>

<p>It was there that we realized that we had a failure with permission errors.</p>

<p><code>$ sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local</code>
and changing it to my username fixed everything!</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to get to work!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>How to set up pre-made Jekyll theme to your created Github Project Pages</h3>

<p>Like most projects I begin, I immediately faced programming trouble and daunting challenges that made me second-guess my original enthusiasm for coding and for life in general.</p>

<p>But, as I have heard many times, patience is a virtue and one that I am sorely lacking. Not only do I consider programming a learning experience, but also as a way to learn how to instill problem solving techniques and practice self-restraint of letting my frustration and anger get the better of me.</p>

<p>So here is the problem I faced today; setting up a custom domain name for my Github Project Page and setting up a Jekyll theme to go along with it. Sounds easy right? I thought so too, but of course I found almost every wrong avenue to implement this&hellip;</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Make sure you have your custom domain name</p>

<p>First, create a cname</p>

<p>Go to the FIRST documents and set up the IP address</p>

<p>Choose a theme</p>

<p>make sure jekyll is installed and other gems</p>

<p>Discuss how to actuall FORK a repo</p>

<p>Download to computer and move to the local repo</p>

<p>NOT A REPO INSIDE OF A REPO</p>

<p>Change the url of the theme if it has one</p>

<p>Remember, you get ONE github page, everyother &lsquo;page&rsquo; you have is actually a sub domain name using /project/ not its own page. Make sure you know this</p>
