<span style="font-weight:bold">The best way to learn about things is to write about them! I wrote a rough draft of a sci-fi novel during the National Novel Writing Month that occurs every Novemer. The plot is about a young girl born into a post-apocolyptic world in which machinary are able to produce all of our basic needs. The lower working class are no longer needed to fuel society and the wealth gap continues to widen as the poor are unable to escape the clutches of poverty. To make matters worse, a new race of transcendent humans threaten the survival of the human race as they hope to rid the planet of lesser-beings. </span>
