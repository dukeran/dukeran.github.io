<p>Before starting this job, I never quite understood why my programmer friends always wanted the latest computer - the faster the better. I also never understood why it was so important to shorten or abbreviate commands such as <code>rails server</code> to <code>rails s</code>. Does typing an extra five characters really matter that much?</p>

<p>This week flew by with impressive speed. This entire week I was either waitressing at the restaurant or sitting in front of a computer, learning or implementing Ruby. And honestly, I feel as if I didn&rsquo;t have enough time in the day to get everything done that I wanted to get done just at Quottly alone. one minute I wrapped my head around Regular Expressions and the next I notice that two hours have gone by in a blink of an eye! When you sit in front of the computer, working with code, it&rsquo;s as if you get stuck into a flow, where for you, time stands still; a minute could be a day or a day could be a minute. When time moves so quickly, every second counts. Every minute that you wait for the computer to load the server takes a good ten minutes off of your day depending on how often you load the server. And then add other factors like playing around with &lsquo;byebug&rsquo; or writing long strings and methods, every character takes a fraction of a second which adds. By the end of the week, the time that was wasted by a slow computer or taking time to type out an entire command could easily add up to half a day. You know what can be accomplished in half a day? A lot. A lot of learning can be accomplished in half a day.</p>

<p>On the same note, I&rsquo;ve decided to cut Netflix out of my life along with the Facebook App on my phone. I am considering deleting Snapchat as well. There are so many things that we have in life that are a distraction and that take time away from our ultimate goals. One of my goals is to be able to read Spanish poetry and guaranteed, if I were to take the amount of hours I spent watching &ldquo;Bones&rdquo; on Netflix this past year alone and instead had spent it on Spanish poetry lessons - I would be gosh darn fluent by now. And I have to ask myself, what good has re-watching &ldquo;Bones&rdquo; been to my life? It has contributed nothing, while Spanish poetry could open the door to so many wondrous and beautiful thoughts.</p>

<p>I feel as if, after graduating, it is incredibly easy to fall into a rut - to go to work, come home exhausted, put on the TV, eat fattening food, and pass out on the couch. I have seen many of my older friends go through this and then two years down the line they are slightly overweight and feeling miserable about their lives. That is not what I plan to do. Three jobs or one job, I am trying to push myself every time I come home to work on something new whether it&rsquo;s blog posts, applying for scholarships, or furthering my programming knowledge, regardless of how tired I am. Because I know, in two or five or ten years down the line, I am not going to remember the fatigue - instead I am going to be proud of where I have ended up.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Everyday I am learning something new</h4>

<p>Today, I learned about databases and migrations. It seems like such a big thing for many intro books to gloss over but gloss over it they do. And there might be good reason to, it&rsquo;s complicated stuff! Even now as I type this I am not quite sure what databases are or how migrations work. However, I do know that naming conventions with Ruby is a tricky business and I learned that lesson the hard way today.</p>

<p>Working on MobiDick, I decided to create a personal bookshelf which I decided to name &lsquo;Pershelf&rsquo;, a nice, easy, and explanatory name (or so I thought). I ran</p>

<p><code>$ bin/rails generate scaffold Pershelf</code></p>

<p><code>$ bin/rails db: migrate</code></p>

<p>Everything so far okay. I modified the app/controllers/concerns/current_pershelf.rb folder and continued to the next step;</p>

<p><code>$ bin/rails generate scaffold LineItem book:references pershelve:belongs_to</code></p>

<p><code>$ bin/rails db:migrate</code></p>

<!--more-->


<p>Aaanddd now the problems begin. I spent a few hours going through test trying to figure out what went wrong, over and over again finding myself with an &lsquo;Undefined variable&rsquo; error. I saw that some files were labeled &lsquo;pershelve&rsquo; and immediately assumed that Ruby had incorrectly tried to pluralize then put the noun into singular form and messed up miserably so I went through all the files trying to rename everything to &lsquo;pershelf&rsquo; and then would put the plural as &lsquo;pershelfs&rsquo;. That definitely did not work. It wasn&rsquo;t until a co-worker of mine told me to look at the /db/schema.rb to take a look at how the database was set up. There it was! There error was as bright as day.</p>

<p>I would never have thought to look at the database and once we realized that it was clearly human error that caused the issues, my co-worker walked me through the steps of fixing the error;</p>

<p>I learned four important lessons today;</p>

<p>Ruby can, in fact, pluralize like a pro (I would love to see how ruby learned to do it so well!)</p>

<p>Maybe coding while sick and with fever is not the best way to code</p>

<p>Keep track of your spelling conventions!</p>

<p>I learned how to fix errors in the database!</p>

<p>pluralization of ruby in rails when generating scaffolding</p>

<p>When you use rails to build scaffolding, it will expect certain conventions</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Dealing with db:seed issues</h4>

<p>Today I added some information into the seeds.rb file and ran <code>$ bin/rails db:seed</code> and then <code>$ ran bin/rails s</code>. To my horror, all the information that I had had was gone! No errors showed up on local host and I felt at a loss since my understanding of databases is so limited. Thankfully with the help of my co-worker, we figured out a solution.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I learned:</p>

<p>If an error occurs with <code>$ bin/rails db:seed</code>, the error can be silent and not appear either on your console or on local host. It&rsquo;s almost like asking Rails what&rsquo;s wrong and she replies wistfully - nothing - but you know something is wrong. So you go ask Ruby by going into the Rails console and start running some tests;</p>

<p><code>$ rails c</code></p>

<p><code>$ Book.all</code>
<br>
 <code>...Book Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "books".* FROM "books"
 =&gt; #&lt;ActiveRecord::Relation []&gt;</code></p>

<!--more-->


<p> Nothing there, at least that tells me that something is wrong, we just don&rsquo;t know what yet.</p>

<p> Here&rsquo;s where we create a book on the console to be able to see what and where things go wrong;</p>

<p><code>$ Book.create!(title: 'WinniePoo', description: %{&lt;p&gt; hello &lt;/p&gt;}, image_url: 'lol.jpg', review: 5.0)</code></p>

<p>(use bang method to throw an error, otherwise it&rsquo;ll fail silently once again) Bang method usually has a destructive side effect when running with a command. Bang is like the antithesis of the command. It is a powerful method that I just learned today! Bang method is unique to the function. (fix this)</p>

<p>Since it has been causing me errors since the beginning. I ran <code>$ Book.create!...</code> again, and this time-success!</p>

<p>I was able to <code>$ bin/rails db:seed</code> and my page is showing the books and data once again :D</p>

<p>Every day I am reminded of how much I still have to learn.</p>

    <id>http://dukeran.github.io/blog/2016/06/27/what-went-wrong-with-postgres</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>The Beginnings</h3>

<p>A couple of days ago I started at my job working for the up and coming ventured back Quottly! It&rsquo;s a starting intern position and I am incredibly excited to for them. For me it&rsquo;s more than just a job, it means progress and growth from when I started a little over a year ago with my first ever programming book. I remember opening the first few pages of that programming book while there was some down time at my waitressing job. A customer has just turned my day from okay to miserable with a few nasty comments and I remembered the book that had been given to me by my good friend James when I had shown some interest in what he did for a living. I had at first taken it a little skeptically, thinking that someone like me could/would never learn to program, that it was already too late for me to start. But after glaring at the customer who had just left I was ready to try to do anything to get out of ever waiting another table again. If there was one thing I knew, it was that I had way too little patience and too much pride to wait on tables for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>Sixth months later I quit my waitressing job to focus on programming and to live life as a broke college student. Seven months later I got hired as a Developer Intern at Quottly, working for the same friend who had given me the book in the first place. I had often come to Quottly&rsquo;s office to work on self-teaching programming books that James had given me or that I had downloaded from various sites after working hours. I would stay up until late at night and would drink copious amounts of coffee until I had learned just enough to get started. Now that my foot is in the door I am hoping that nothing will hold me back!</p>

<p>That enthusiastic attitude that I had my first day nearly died earlier today once faced with the task of setting up. What is it about setting up the workspace that always takes me forever? In the very beginning, it was issues with Git, then it was issues with Rails servers, and today, it was an issue with postgres.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>It appeared that setting up a Development Environment on OSX would be easy enough. I doubled check to make sure I had Homebrew up and working</p>

<p><code>$ brew --version</code></p>

<p>Used RVM to install the correct Ruby version and then&hellip; came the trouble. Installing postgres can be very simple if everything is going right (which it rarely does for me);</p>

<p><code>$ brew install postgres</code></p>

<p>Then launch the following commands;</p>

<p><code>$ ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents</code></p>

<p><code>$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist</code></p>

<p>It appeared to be installing properly, everything looked nice, green, and working. Then there was this message right under a few paragraphs;</p>

<p><code>...fixing permissions on existing directory /usr/local/var/postgres ... initdb: could not change permissions of directory "/usr/local/var/postgres": Operation not permitted</code></p>

<p>hmmm. The first few times I tried installing and re-installing postgres (after failure to migrate) I hadn&rsquo;t noticed the message. If this message goes unnoticed, you&rsquo;re not able to <code>rake db:create db:migrate db:seed</code>. When I tried to <code>rake db:migrate</code> with the above mentioned error, I a long block of code (this is just the snippet);</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip;/usr/local/Cellar/ruby/1.9.3-p327/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activerecord-3.2.8/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql_adapter.rb:1213:in <code>initialize'

/usr/local/Cellar/ruby/1.9.3-p327/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activerecord-3.2.8/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql_adapter.rb:1213:in <code>connect'

/usr/local/Cellar/ruby/1.9.3-p327/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activerecord-3.2.8/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql_adapter.rb:28:in `new'
&hellip;..
&hellip;&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Yikes!</p>

<p>A teammate suggested typing;</p>

<p><code>$ psql</code></p>

<p>and I received back;</p>

<p><code>...Is the server running locally and accepting
    connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432</code></p>

<p>Fishy stuff. That at least got us on the right track. At this point I had uninstalled and re-installed postgres multiple times to no avail. The files existed for postgres! I check them multiple times at</p>

<p><code>$ ls /usr/local/var/postgres/</code></p>

<p>But it still wouldn&rsquo;t work. Then, I did something that I should&rsquo;ve done from the very, very, very beginning. Would have saved me and others hours. I went to the troubleshooting link that was in the message sent to me after installing postgres;</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting">https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting</a></p>

<p>It was there that we realized that we had a failure with permission errors.</p>

<p><code>$ sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local</code>
and changing it to my username fixed everything!</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to get to work!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>How to set up pre-made Jekyll theme to your created Github Project Pages</h3>

<p>Like most projects I begin, I immediately faced programming trouble and daunting challenges that made me second-guess my original enthusiasm for coding and for life in general.</p>

<p>But, as I have heard many times, patience is a virtue and one that I am sorely lacking. Not only do I consider programming a learning experience, but also as a way to learn how to instill problem solving techniques and practice self-restraint of letting my frustration and anger get the better of me.</p>

<p>So here is the problem I faced today; setting up a custom domain name for my Github Project Page and setting up a Jekyll theme to go along with it. Sounds easy right? I thought so too, but of course I found almost every wrong avenue to implement this&hellip;</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Make sure you have your custom domain name</p>

<p>First, create a cname</p>

<p>Go to the FIRST documents and set up the IP address</p>

<p>Choose a theme</p>

<p>make sure jekyll is installed and other gems</p>

<p>Discuss how to actuall FORK a repo</p>

<p>Download to computer and move to the local repo</p>

<p>NOT A REPO INSIDE OF A REPO</p>

<p>Change the url of the theme if it has one</p>

<p>Remember, you get ONE github page, everyother &lsquo;page&rsquo; you have is actually a sub domain name using /project/ not its own page. Make sure you know this</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Hardcore Parcour</h3>

<p>After going through three tutorial books on Ruby, Sinatra, and Ruby on Rails (one each respectively) I still struggled with my first kata from Code Wars.
Code Wars (give a brief description)</p>

<p>The name of the kata is Stringy Strings and it has very straightforward instructions;</p>

<blockquote><p>write me a function stringy that takes a size and returns a string of alternating &lsquo;1s&rsquo; and &lsquo;0s&rsquo;.</p>

<p>the string should start with a 1.</p>

<p>a string with size 6 should return :&lsquo;101010&rsquo;.</p>

<p>with size 4 should return : &lsquo;1010&rsquo;.</p>

<p>with size 12 should return : &lsquo;101010101010&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The size will always be positive and will only use whole numbers</p></blockquote>

<p>I have to admit, I was at quite a loss - a feeling that was incredibly frustrating.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>You&rsquo;re given the following:</p>

<p>def stringy(size)
 (insert your code here)
end</p>

<p>I first thought about how to approach the problem in the most simple way possible. How could I break it down so that the string starting at one?</p>

<p>my first thought was to start at: &lsquo;&rsquo;&lsquo;base = &ldquo;1&rdquo;&rsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo; and go from there. I recalled the first method I internalized;</p>

<p>(1..size).each do |number|</p>

<p>because size is within the parenthesis, Ruby knows that size is going to be a variable for a number. The &ldquo;number&rdquo; put into &ldquo;| |&rdquo; symbolism is giving a variable name to what is inside the parenthesis.
I figured that for every other number I would want a &ldquo;1&rdquo; and then a &ldquo;0&rdquo; so with this dichotomy I figured I could equate it to even and odds. For every odd I would assign a &ldquo;1&rdquo; value and for every even I would assign a &ldquo;0&rdquo; value. Mind you, I was writing anything that came to mind and erasing and cleaning up things as I went. At this point I removed the base = &ldquo;1&rdquo; since I would be no longer needing it if my array started at 1 and I could assign a &ldquo;1&rdquo; on the 1 value.</p>

<p>after running a few tests, I came up with the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>`</p>

<p>This did not work quite how I wanted it to:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="mi">1</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="mi">0</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="mi">1</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="mi">0</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="mi">1</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">5</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>First of all, what was with the <code>1..5</code>? I was confused and so I asked a friend. Ruby, when not given a specific task, will regurgitate as much as she can, trying to give you as much information as possible unless specified otherwise. Since nothing was specified between the end of the <code>if</code>, <code>else</code> and the <code>end</code> of the defining method, then ruby told you the parameters of what she did was between 1 and 5, hence the 1..5. Another thing to note is that Ruby gave us the 1&rsquo;s and 0&rsquo;s we were looking for, but not in a consecutive line. It turns out that ruby will print out each variable on its own line unless specifically told not to.</p>

<p>The next round I specifically told ruby to print the variables on the same line:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">stringy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">size</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">size</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">times</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="o">|</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">number</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">even?</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">string</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">&#39;1&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">else</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">string</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">&#39;0&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">string</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Also, what is significant about this code compared to the last code I tried is that in the first code I applied a function to the range and in the second code I used a method and applied it to a variable. For example in the first code <code>(1..size).each do |number|</code> the <code>.each</code> applies to the inclusive range, applying the function to each number in the range.
In the second code in the third line <code>size.times do |n|</code>, the <code>.times</code>  function means that the method will perform that function as many times as you specify in the <code>n</code> variable.
In this case, there isn&rsquo;t much difference between the two except that <code>.times</code> can be applied to a stand-alone variable while <code>.each</code> <em>has to</em> apply to more than one variable. It is perfectly acceptable to write <code> (1..size).each do |number|</code> in the second code on line 3 in place of what is there.</p>

<p>A few other solutions were:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">stringy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">size</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.size</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">map</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">number</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">even?</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="s1">&#39;0&#39;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;1&#39;</span> <span class="p">}</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this case I learned something knew. I hadn&rsquo;t seen the <code>.map</code> function before. <code>.map</code> applies a function onto every single member of that range. The curly brackets are a shorthand for <code>do</code>/<code>end</code>, allowing the entire method to be on one line, shortening the code. The <code>?</code> is calling up the Boolean method (see previous post) and the <code>:</code> act as an OR method.</p>

<p>Ever since I was young, I had dreamed about going to the Amazon. Something about the river always made me imagine of adventure - of trekking through the jungle in search of a lost city. My grandfather used to buy me National Geographic magazines when I first learned to read and I remember staring at the pictures and cutting out the ones of the Amazon to tape up all over my wall, to the frustration of my parents. As I got older, My room was covered with world maps, each map marked with circles of where I would someday travel, always a big black line tracing the Amazon.</p>

<p>And there it was. The Amazon.</p>

<p>The section we were flying over was winding, brown, and languid, stretching as far as the eye could see with nothing but tropical canopy to match.</p>

<!--more-->


<h5>A few facts about the Amazon:</h5>

<ul>
<li>The second longest River in the world, accounts for 1/5 of the world&rsquo;s total river flow</li>
<li>The Amazon flows through Brazil</li>
<li>The Amazon is the rainforest&rsquo;s highway, providing transportation, trade, and communication between communities</li>
<li>Many of the Amazon port cities are only accessible by water or air</li>
<li>During the flood season, the Amazon fertilizes the surrounding soil</li>
<li>The Amazon River is a source of food for the communities living on the banks</li>
<li>Home of the Amazon river dolphin</li>
</ul>


<p>Thankfully living in Florida prepared Charlotte and I for the humidity that hit us as we disembarked the plane when it landed in Iquitos. The airport was small and there was dust everywhere. We climbed into our first South American rickshaw and gave the driver our hostel&rsquo;s name. With all the dust, dogs, and kids running around in dirty clothes it was hard to believe that Iquitos was once home to rubber barons, an opera house, and great mansions. Some of the mansions still stand today, but only as shadows of their former glory. Those were not necessarily good times for Iquitos, however. The rubber boom of the early 19th century meant wealth but it also meant that many companies such as the Peruvian Amazon Company (rubber company ) horrifically abused workers in the depths of the Amazon. Now, Iquitos serves as one of the main trading hubs of the Amazon, a center for timber, oil and mineral resources. Not to mention, Iquitos has a booming tourist industry as people from all over the world want to catch a glimpse of one of the seven natural wonders of the world; the Amazon River.</p>

<p>The second we registered our names in to the hostel leger, we were ushered into a common room and told to wait a few moments. A older woman from Spain joined us and before long a native from Iquitos introduced himself and gave us a pitch for a three-day adventure into the Amazon. Charlotte kept elbowing me in the ribs because I could hardly keep my eyes open and my head kept falling onto her shoulder. I was exhausted from the red-eye flight to Iquitos &hellip; and from the fact that we hadn&rsquo;t slept the night before because we we had been celebrating the opening of a new club down in Lima with new friends.</p>

<p>Raul, the Iquitian, was from a local travel company geared towards tourists and he told us about piranha fishing, swimming in the amazon, sleeping in hammocks, etc. A trip that sounded honestly amazing to me. Charlotte and I had looked online at possible Amazon tours but the prices had been outrages - ranging anywhere from $400 (if you were lucky) to $800 for a two night, three-day trek into the rainforest. Since our budget was limited, we decided to hold off before deciding on any $400 trek.</p>

<p>Everything Raul said sounded great, but just wait for it&hellip;and there! The price <strong>$500</strong>. Uh huh, no way. I was ready to gather my bags and head up to our rooms for a much needed nap when the lady from Spain, Mari Carmen came into play. She grabbed our hands, told Raul how we were family and that we should receive a discount since the three of us came together. She was nitpicky, arguing that the individual prices for each event would only cost so-and-so and that she might as well hire a native Iquitian to give us a personal tour instead of a local tour company. Little by little Raul lowered the prices until we were looking at $250 each for the entire three days, all meals included, and an extra excursion added on. The three of us jumped on it.</p>

<p>After money and handshakes were transferred (business was done with a word oath and then later with receipts) Mari Carmen winked at us and told us that we owed her one. We sure did!</p>

<p>At this point, both Charlotte and I were exhausted. We grabbed a quick lunch of fried fish in the town plaza and then lazily made our way back to our room to recover from the night before.</p>

<p>  I am almost a week into my trip in Peru and I have yet to write a blog post about it! I never know how to start, should I write about reccommendations of where to go? Or should I just focus solely on Ruby and make a few mentions about Peru. I guess a blend of the two would be best. Then there&rsquo;s the struggle of finding time to write. My travel partner and I are always on the go, whether we&rsquo;re exploring Lima or trying new food.</p>

<p>  The first five days we were in Lima, the capital city of Peru. I had packed for a full on winter with long underwear, fleece layers, wool socks, etc. only to find myself sweating in long pants and a T-shirt by noon. The weather is noticeably different from my hometown in Naples, Florida. Instead of constant sun, Lima has constant cloud cover. Clouds that loom low over the city and make it impossible to determine if it&rsquo;s raining or if you&rsquo;re constantly walking around in damp, ground-level clouds.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>  We stayed in the Miraflores district in a hostel called Pariwana which I would reccomend to anyone, however I can&rsquo;t say the same about Miraflores. Miraflores is a more modern and well-off district in Lima but it is full of USA fast-food chains and empty department stores. However, the bus station isn&rsquo;t far away and it is easy to get to downtown Lima where you can see catacombs and the governor&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>  The hostel we stayed in was always full of backpackers and trekkers from all over the world, though they tended to be Western, middle class, and experienced in the ways of backpacking. I have yet to meet anyone who says, &ldquo;this is my first trip abroad&rdquo;. I could have spent whole days in the hostel lounge area sitting on giant pillows and enjoying cups of coco tea while swapping stories with other backpackers. Everyone has a different perspective and have experienced different things while on the road and are happy to give reccommendations.</p>

<p>  In fact it is because of this interchange that Charlotte and I decided to completely go off our itinerary and take a flight towards Iquitos instead of Cusco. Charlotte and I had laid out a map of Peru and were discussing which bus to take and which hostels had the best deals over beer and cigars when someone mentioned that if we get a chance we should head towards Iquitos which is in the Peruvian rainforest and is only accessable by plane. Before long we were booking our flight out into the Amazon.</p>

<p>  While in the hostel in Lima, I tried to improve the program that I had written about in my last blog post about my cat, Thea. One evening I had brought out my laptop to have Charlotte give a go at trying to keep virtual Thea happy and well-fed (since sometimes my cat likes to have other people play with her than just me). Before long the laptop was being passed from person to person as everyone tried keep Thea content. It was a great way to find out which part of the code had bugs and how I could improve the program itself. Soon I made it where Thea could kill you if she became too hungry, if she became too bored, or if you didn&rsquo;t take her to the bathroom. I increased the difficulty and soon we were playing that whoever could survive the longest with my fierce cat would be the winner. This was definitely a great way to meet new people and to work on my code!</p>

<p>Thanks to a friend of mine, I&rsquo;ve recently been doing a lot of Kata on <strong>Codewars</strong>. If you&rsquo;ve never done katas on Codewars before, I would <em>highly, highly, highly</em> recommend it. It&rsquo;s a great site where your competitive nature can get the best of you as you compete with other friends for &lsquo;honor&rsquo;. There are eight levels of difficulty and each kata is a creative coding problem that you solve for honor points. The beginner&rsquo;s level, level 8, is a good overview of incredibly basic coding concepts. Once you enter your solution you are able to see how others solved the same kata.</p>

<p>&ndash;> <a href="http://www.codewars.com">http://www.codewars.com</a></p>

<p>My username is <strong>dukeran</strong> if you want to add me!</p>

<h5><em>special note: if the same solution was posted by more than two people then I will not site the code.</em></h5>

<p>After going through Chris Pine&rsquo;s <em>Learn to Program</em>  book, here is the solution I came up with:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">boolean_to_string</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>          <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s2">&quot;true&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>          <span class="k">else</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s2">&quot;false&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is a straightforward code which works just fine but doesn&rsquo;t utilize the fundamental concept of Boolean values.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until I saw other answers and started doing some research that I learned more about it. It started when I saw the most popular answer and was instantly confused:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">boolean_to_string</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">b</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="s2">&quot;true&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;false&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At first I cocked my head and then wiped my glasses. First of all, what does the <code>?</code> mean? and why don&rsquo;t you have to specifically tell ruby that <code>if b = true...</code> How does ruby automatically know to test for true and false?</p>

<p>The program above may seem painfully simple to any programmer worth their salt but to a newbie in the field, it was a confusionfest - especially when it comes to Ruby. I find that as a Linguistics major with no background in coding, many expert programmers assume that these fundamentals are pure common sense. This is not the case for most non-programmers and I want to break everything down step by step.</p>

<h5>George Boole, the Foundation Layer</h5>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with George Boole because I always find coding processes/fundamentals easier to swallow when the human element is added to make it a bit more personal. George Boole (1815-1864) was an Eglishman who is credited with laying the foundations for the informational age - the period that marked the shift from Industrial Revolution to what we have today with an economy based on information computerization. Without much formal teaching, he taught himeslf algebra and calculus using mathematics books. He became a prominent member of society and began publishing his own academic articles, lending insight into linear differential equations, invariant theory, and symbolic logic. Also, I learned that Boole is famous for using the term &ldquo;Universe of Discourse&rdquo; which is an important and fundamental concept to the linguistic study of pragmatics and semantics!!
In an attempt to systematize and categorize Airstotelian logic in order to be ableto extend its range of application, Boole created the beginnings of  Boolean logic.</p>

<h5>So What is the Difference Between Boolean logic and Aristotelian Logic?</h5>

<p>Aristotelian logic, or term logic, begins with the fundamental assumption that propositions are composed of two terms. The term is a part of speech which carries no truth value but instead represents something such as &ldquo;man&rdquo; or &ldquo;cat&rdquo;. The proposition is what consists of two terms, the &ldquo;affirmed&rdquo; or &ldquo;denied&rdquo; and the subject which is capable of true or false. Finally, the syllogism is the inference, or conclusion, that one can make from the premises.
Propositions can be either <strong>Universal and affirmative</strong>, <strong>Particular and affirmative</strong>, <strong>Universal and negative</strong>, or *Particular and negative**.</p>

<p>Fun Fact: Mary Everest Boole, his wife, was also a self-taught mathematician and was a strong advocate for teaching children Science at a young age and to make mathematics fun for the young. She often helped George Boole on his academic papers and attended conferences with him as well, unheard of for women of the time. She supported the idea that arithmetic was more anthropomorphic instead of purely abstract.</p>

<p>need to have a question mark to denote the boolean theory!!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>How I coped with leaving my family and beginning my 2 month trip exploring South America - through code!</h4>

<p>And so it has begun! My friend Charlotte and I have boarded our flight for    Lima, the capital of Peru. Saying goodbye to my family and extended family brought tears to my eyes.</p>

<div id="container">
<br>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9AljWer.png"  alt="My own cat picture" height="300" width="300" style="margin:10px 10px">
</center>
</div>


<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel bittersweet as we drove out   of my driveway towards the airport, leaving my family waving at the doorstep of   the house. Going on big trips is always bittersweet for me, I always hate   saying goodbye to those I love but at the same time I can&rsquo;t wait for another   adventure to begin. For me, there is nothing like new sites to see and new   experiences to be had, all the while meeting new and interesting people.</p>

<p>Like most other people on the internet, I&rsquo;m obsessed with my cat. She is my   pride and joy, even if she can be a bit peevish sometimes. I swear, with the   rate of cat pictures being uploaded daily, the percentage of Mr. Whiskers   pictures might surpass the amount of porn to be found on the web.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Since I am going to miss my little feline buddy, I decided to practice some of   my new coding skills, using the few tools I have in my tool kit. In the   following code (with the help of Chris Pine&rsquo;s example as a template) I created a   little virtual cat that I can take care of while I&rsquo;m away from my living, breathing fuzzball. I named the program Thea, after my precious fuzzball.</p>

<p><strong>The items I used in my recently aquired tool kit:</strong>
<em>variables
</em>loops
<em>recursion
</em>creating a new class
*defining methods</p>

<p>And&hellip;that about sums up my entire tool kit. Hopefully one day that list will   be longer!</p>

<p>My most recently aquired tool is <em>defining a class</em>. A brand new and exciting   concept. This time I initialized the <code>class Pet</code>
Note that class remains lowercase while the new class that you are initializing   is capitalized. One thing that was stressed in Chris Pine&rsquo;s book is the   difference between <code>new</code> and <code>initialize</code>. It&rsquo;s not a horribly confusing   concept but I want to go over it real quick. <code>new</code> comes first. You cannot   initialize something that has not yet been created! <code>new</code> creates the objet   that the computer will then <code>initialize</code>. <code>new</code> creates the object only, it is   never used again while <code>initialized</code> needs to be defined because you need to   explain to your poor computer what you want to do with this brand new object.   You can only use <code>new</code> to <em>create</em> a new object, if you use <code>initialize</code> in   order to create a new object, the computer will freak out, looking for some    nonexistant object to start up, and will spit out a panic-stricken error code.   Yes, personalizing the computer and its languages makes it easier for me to   understand, hopefully it does for you too!</p>

<p>This one <code>class</code> is 155 lines long and it only takes one to initialize it and  to get it running.</p>

<p>Within the <code>class</code> I have defined over seven different methods;
* <code>initialize</code>
* <code>feed</code>
* <code>play</code>
* <code>walk</code>
* <code>put_to_bed</code>
* <code>code</code></p>

<p>In each <code>def</code> (define) I clearly lay out the groundworks for how I want the   computer to respond in different scenarios. In this code I only have two   possible environments; asleep and not asleep. I can only imagine this makes it   easier to keep track of all the possiblities and possible behaviors. I   definitely suggest if you try writing this code for practice and you&rsquo;re new   like me, start with only two different possible scenarios until you&rsquo;re able to   effortlessly keep track of all the different possibilities.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s one thing that confused me when I first read the template and started   writing my own program. What the heck does &ldquo; <code>@variable</code> mean? In the first 5   lines of code there is this new symbol that I&rsquo;ve never used before: &rdquo;<code>@</code>&ldquo;. Much   confused. I decided to look it up and explain it to other newbies: the <code>@</code> signifies an instance variable of the specific class. It is important because it only functions within the class and you use it to tell the computer that you want something done in that particular instance. It&rsquo;s also cool because it is the same variable but at different defined instances you assign it a different value.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick snippet from one of the <code>def</code> methods:</p>

<p>I think in the big picture this is an amazing thing about Ruby. This is line 13 to 20 of the code. I have in no way defined the variable <code>passageoftime</code> or <code>peeve</code>. I don&rsquo;t  define them until line 91 and line 125. To me, this is so not intuitive.  Imagine going up to someone and being like &ldquo;Remember that blubber story?&rdquo; and   then laugh. That person is going to look at you like you&rsquo;ve lost your freaking   mind because s/he has no context or no idea what you could possibly be   referring to. Later that day you walk up to that same person and tell him/her  a hilarious story about how you were living with some Inuits up in Alaska and you   thought the blubber they offered you was ice cream until you took your first   bite. Now this person has context and can laugh with you. But this is only after you have taken a random variable of &ldquo;blubber&rdquo; and put it into a context.   It doesn&rsquo;t need to work this way with Ruby! You do the same thing with   Ruby and she will know to laugh earlier in the day even before you told the   blubber story just because you told it later that day. It&rsquo;s as if Ruby is living in a world where she processes your code so fast that time doesn&rsquo;t   exist in a linear fashion. Whether something happens in the past or in the   future doesn&rsquo;t matter to it, as long as it is all in that one instance of code.   If this isn&rsquo;t cool to you, then well, you lack imagination and excitement in   your life&hellip;</p>

<p>A new thing I learned while writing this code is the (method/function?)   <code>private</code>. It means that the following code and its functions can only be   modified in the code itself and the user running the program can&rsquo;t access it.   It&rsquo;s like the hidden part of the code that is running behind the scenes and   makes the interface run smoothly.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the loop that I threw into my code!</p>

<p>I love the concept of <code>while true</code>. I&rsquo;m sure a lot could be written about just   that one concept but I&rsquo;m tired and this kid behind me keeps hitting my seat  and crying. Has anyone ever been on a flight without any kids? I feel as if that  is as rare as finding a wild unicorn.
Anyways I used this loop here in order to keep the program continuing until it   terminates on its own either because the virtual cat becomes too hungry or too   peevish. My cat can become a monster when she is cranky and peeved by us   humans messing with her, so I decided that the program would end if she became   too upset with the human interacting with her. No one likes a grumpy, cranky   cat, unless of course you&rsquo;re the owner of Grumpy Cat and you&rsquo;re making it rain   from all the royalties.
One thing that I really enjoy about this loop is it&rsquo;s incredibly simple and   that you can keep piling on the <code>elsif</code>. Truly, as many as you want. As long   as the <code>if</code> gets a counter <code>else</code> and you put the correct number of <code>ends</code> all   is good in the computer world.</p>

<p>The link to my full code can be found <a href="https://github.com/dukeran/thea">here on github</a>! I&rsquo;ll also write a post   about how I got github to work for me, since it&rsquo;s not user friendly to those  who are new to the tech world.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>How I am going to keep track of everything</h4>

<p>I am counting down the days until I board my flight to the captial of Peru!! I wrote a small program that will display my statement of purpose, my itinerary, and how many more days I have left until my return flight. Since Archer is one of my favorite TV shows, I often run my programs under the name of Woodhouse and he is incredibly helpful. In this blog post I&rsquo;ve linked my incredibly simple program to github so you guys can take a look!
The beginning was easy. I tried to use a little bit of everything I&rsquo;ve learned in the first ten chapters of <em>Learn to Code</em> by Chris Pine.</p>

<p>I used my first array:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">options</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[[</span><span class="s1">&#39;Statement of Purpose&#39;</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>                  <span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;Itinerary&#39;</span>           <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>                  <span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;Days Left &#39;</span>       <span class="o">]]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>I have to admit, I&rsquo;m still a little confused on what exactly an array is. Chris Pine usually does an excellent job explaining things so I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m just unusually thick or if array&rsquo;s are actually a hard concept for a newbie to understand right away.</p>

<p>After doing a little research, it seems to me that an array is listing of objects which all share a common element. The computer is able to see them as individual units but also as a singular group unit which is valuable when you&rsquo;re dealing with a large amount of objects. EXAMPLE two different groups of objects and the comp has to deal with them in seperate ways.</p>

<p>Here comes Woodhouse!!</p>

<p>I love the <code>def</code> function, which is just short for &lsquo;define&rsquo;. IF there is one thing I&rsquo;m certain about, is that programmers will find the laziest way to type/do everything. As James explained it to me, the define function is like creating a written contract with your computer. You tell it that under these circumstances I want you to do the following&hellip; And you explain in detail exactly how you want it to behave. I love it! It allows for so much creativity. So the <code>def</code> alerts the computer/program that you&rsquo;re are about to give it its contract. The <code>ask</code> is the actual command that you define and will use in the future, while <code>question</code> is the variable that you&rsquo;ll define after the contract is written. In the code I wrote above, the <code>'Miss, which would you like to know about?'</code> is how I decided to define the varibale <code>question</code>.</p>

<p>Another thing that I would like to point out to other newbie coders of Ruby is that <code>elsif</code> is a subset of the <code>if</code> function, and that <code>else</code> is the counterpart to the <code>if</code>. You can fit as many <code>elsif</code>s as you want under <code>if</code> but you can&rsquo;t keep piling on the <code>else</code>s after the <code>if</code>. One <code>if</code> and one <code>else</code> within a loop. I learned that after much frustration.</p>

<p>The second part of the code is the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>        <span class="n">ask</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Miss, which would you like to know about?&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This was actually the hardest part of the code. I spent more time on this part than I should have because I kept crashing my computer. I made the mistake of putting in</p>

<p><code>ruby
while
        true
    if reply == 'yes' ...etc
   </code></p>

<p>Which made my computer have a panic attack as it tried to compute the huge motherload of tasks I had just given it. To repeat the loop infinatum. Impossible, so my computer took the easy way out and committed suicide every time. Poor thing. I just removed the <code>while true</code> and it fixed everything.</p>

For the past month before my trip I have been familiarizing myself with the chromebook and with Chris Pine&rsquo;s <em>Learn to Program</em> (second edition).</p>

<h4>The Technology: Dell CRM3120-1667BLK 11.6" Chromebook</h4>

<p>This has been my favorite laptop that I have ever used. Granted, I haven&rsquo;t used more than probably 3 clunky old laptops but I can gaurantee that this is undoubtably my favorite. It&rsquo;s small, fast, spill proof (incredibly important when it comes to me), and it isn&rsquo;t loaded down with stupid and unecessary programs. All this for the price $199.99 on Amazon which makes it a steal unless you&rsquo;re planning to use it for gaming&hellip;but I don&rsquo;t know much about that since I&rsquo;m all about the Xbox.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>So far this laptop has worked great for the few things that I need a laptop to do; browse reddit, code Ruby, watch Archer, and stream&hellip;videos. Thankfully my friend James Gibson was able to install chroot in order for us to play with the linux system and install Ruby.
If anyone is interested in the chromebook, here&rsquo;s the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FBBUIDM/ref=psdc_565108_t1_B00K1FY3M0">link</a> for it on Amazon</p>

<h4>Knowledge is Power: <em>Learn to Program</em> second edition by Chris Pine</h4>

<p>When James first lent me this book, it was pristine and the spine unbroken. Now it lays here, dog-eared, marked, highlighted, and coffee stained (that&rsquo;s why the spill-proof laptop was so valuable). I have read it cover to cover and overall I would give it an excellent rating. The beginning 8 chapters are phenomenal; easy to read and even made me chuckle. His smooth writing and horrible jokes made the book fun and actually motivated me to do the challenging assignments at the end of each chapter. However, chapter 9 left me feeling abandoned and inccapable as he leaped into more complicated coding without any actual teaching. Chapter 9 and on had me pulling my hair and asking my friends for help constantly because in my mind it was either sink or swim. However, I kept at it and when I finished the book I definitely beleived that the book was 100% worth it. It serves as an excellent reference guide and opened the door to how coders think and the problems they face. It also served as an excellent foundation to someone who has never had an inkling of coding before in her life.</p>

<p>His chapters and the concepts he covered are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Numbers - Integers and Floats</li>
<li>Strings</li>
<li>puts, gets, and chomp methods</li>
<li>branching</li>
<li>looping</li>
<li>arrays</li>
<li>Classes - hash class and time class</li>
<li>Methods that take and return procs</li>
</ul>


<p>As a newbie coder, some of the concepts were harder than others. I&rsquo;m still trying to wrap my head around arrays and how they exactly work. But overall, I must say thanks to Chris Pine for his excellent introduction.</p>

<p>In a few days I will be using another book/source in order to continue learning while in Peru. I definitely still have a lot of qustions that hopefully I&rsquo;ll figure out as I learn more about Ruby, such as what is YAML and why do developers love recursive acronyms so much?</p>

<p>Life is full of surprises. Four years ago, if I was told that one day I would be writing a travel blog about coding, I would have laughed. Four years ago I was herding cows in the Atlas mountains in Morocco, living with the Berber people in a tiny village that didn&rsquo;t have running water, let alone internet or computers. Even up to a couple of months ago I hadn&rsquo;t the slightest idea of what coding entailed or what Ruby even was&hellip;</p>

<p>One night, a good friend of mine started pitching the idea of coding over a couple of beers. It was cold outside and the two tankards of Blue Moon had warmed me up to the idea of learning a computer language. After all, I thought, I am a linguistics student, learning a computer language can&rsquo;t be all that difficult after my experiences learning languages such as Chinese and Russian. Boy, was I wrong. <!--more-->
After just a few weeks with my <em>Learning to Program</em> by Chris Pine, I quickly discovered that learning to code is a whole different animal. Not only are you learning how to create code in order to communicate to the computer but you also have to learn how it thinks. I no longer consider sorting words in alphabetical order to be an easy task. Things that I had taken for granted such as defining &lsquo;word&rsquo; and the idea of compiling a list has had me pulling my hair out as my code would fail again and again. But it is through these failures that I have learned what I know about precious Ruby and have come to realize that so far I am actually thoroughly enjoying myself.</p>

<p>In less than a month I&rsquo;ll be doing what I was born to do; traveling. Every summer and every chance I get I pack my bag and head out to new country to explore life and all it has to offer from the riches of Chinese five star hotels to the rustic Moroccan village. Except this time it&rsquo;s going to be a bit different and my bag will weigh just a pound heavier as I travel with this tiny Dell Chromebook throughout the roads of Peru and Ecuador. While there, I&rsquo;m going to be learning to code everyday and writing about my experiences at least once a week. I&rsquo;m only at the initial stages of learning how to code and the more I study and practice the more I realize that there is so much still to learn. I&rsquo;m writing this blog as a way to keep myself disciplined and to track my progression as I conitnue to learn Ruby and travel. If you&rsquo;re reading this I hope you enjoy what follows and I would appreciate feedback since this is a new experience for me!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Check out the introduction to the draft of the novel I wrote for NanoWrimo! Please give me some feedback so I can improve the writing style and write up some more drafts before publishing.</p>

<p><em>The bulky grey heart monitor recorded the irregular heart beat of a young girl as she laid in a hospital bed. The monitor flickered, creating an eerie glow around the girl that flashed in and out with each beat. The girl in question lay motionless, her brown hair, bunched in matted dreads from dirt and sweat, framed her gaunt face. Her big, almost sinister, grey eyes were fixed on the only other person in the room&hellip;
</em> <!--more-->&hellip;a skinny and frail man dressed in a white lab coat. He had just entered the small room just moments before. The man swallowed nervously and approached the bed, careful to position himself at least arms-length away&hellip;</p>

<p>The girl didn’t move an inch but her eyes followed his every movement.
The man leaned forward an inch, “What’s your name, sweetie?” he said, his voice higher pitched than he had wanted. He cleared his throat.
The only answer was the heart monitor.
“How old are you?” He tried again, the hairs on the back of his neck standing on end.
The grey eyes flickered and she blinked but made no other movement.<br/>
“Where were you before you came here?” by now his heart was pounding against his rib cage, his hands clammy.</p>

<p>There was movement from the door and the man visibly jolted in fear. As the door opened, a tall woman entered the room, she too was wearing a labcoat and she walked towards the man with long, confident strides. Her lips were in a thin line and turned slightly downwards in frustration. The man turned to her, unable to hide his feelings of relief at having someone else at his side.
“Baptiste, sir,” said the man and with his new found confidence, he turned to Baptiste and asked, “Is she stupid or just plain mute?”
The woman stood beside the man, seeming to ponder his question as she stared at the young girl. The silence in the room was almost unbearable, and the heart monitor only made it worse.
“Leave,” said Baptiste, her voice carrying the authority of a leader and she never once took her eyes off the girl.
The man didn’t need to be told twice and he exited the room with as much fanfare as he had entered.
When the man left the room, the girl’s owlish eyes shifted towards the woman who was now at her bedside. Baptiste didn’t say a word, if this was going to be a waiting game, then she would wait with all the patience in the world. At last, a small but steady voice was heard, “I have a message for Andrea Parks”.
Baptiste completely pale but retained her composure, “A message for whom?”
“Andrea Parks,” came the measured reply. The grey eyes didn’t reveal any emotion.
“What is the message?”
“I don’t know, but I have to deliver it to Andrea Parks.”
Baptiste glanced up at the wall for a few seconds and then brought her gaze back down to look upon the young girl, “Andrea Parks was executed for treason five years ago”.
A look of surprise flashed through the girl’s eyes before she quickly closed them. With a faint whisper she said, “but Andrea Parks is my mother”.
After hearing those words, Baptiste turned on her heels and all but fled from the sparse hospital room into the grimy hallway where a fluorescent light flickered, the door slamming behind her.
Just outside the room, two scientists waited.
Baptiste barked orders, “I want a full physical done on this girl, I want to know exactly how old she is, where she comes from, and how the fuck she knows Andrea Parks.&ldquo;
“Yes Ms. Baptiste, sir” The other two acknowledged her orders and swiftly went down the hallway.
Baptiste furrowed her brow as she leaned against the wall that separated her from the girl on the other side. All she could hear was the incessant beeping and her thoughts wandered back to the painful memories of her past. “Oh, Andrea”&hellip;she whispered to herself as she slid down the wall, drew her knees up and cupped her head in her hands.</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door.
“Come in,” Baptiste put down her travel logs that she had just been furiously looking through and looked down her glasses as one of the scientists entered the small cozy room. Baptiste sat in an armchair, a small lamp casting a warm glow on a wooden desk and a framed picture of a forest that hung on the other wall. The scientist sat on the other side of the desk in a chair that constituted the only other piece of furniture in the room.
Doctor Sanders didn’t say anything as he slid five polaroid photos across the table. Baptiste picked up the photos and looked at each one intently before saying, “Show me”.
Doctor Sanders led the way as the two walked down the hallway just a few doors down. He opened the door and Baptiste noted that two more monitors were hooked up to the girl, the cords disappearing under the blanket that she had pulled up to her chin. Doctor Sanders approached the bed and, without saying anything, ripping back the sheet from the girl’s body, revealing her naked torso. Baptiste drew in a sharp intake of breath, “Son of a bitch!”
The gaunt eyes of the young girl looked defiantly up at Baptiste and she made no move to cover herself.
Her torso was covered in black marks the resembled circuitry as they spread like tendrils from her heart to her extremities. They covered her entire left side and faded back into the skin as the tendrils reached out from the heart.
Sanders began his report as Baptistes eyes followed the shape of the markings. “The labwork says she is exactly twelve years old as of today.” Baptiste gave him a look of is that all you could find out? He continued, “due to her&hellip;irregularities we analyzed her DNA sequence and we found something quite astounding.” Sanders led the way back out of the hallway into a lab next door. Clearly the most expensive room in the dilapidated hospital, the lights shone brightly upon all the top quality machines that buzzed softly. Sanders and Baptiste now stood in front of a three panel monitor; one monitor was running DNA sequences, the other one was running numbers, and the third was slowly typing out words. Sometimes the third monitor would type three letters, pause, and then continue at a halting pace. (Little by little  want a different phrase) it was possible to tease out the words being written out and then the sentences that followed.
Sanders turned to Baptiste, “A message has been encoded into her DNA.”
He continued, “The girl is not only the messenger but also the message.”</p>
